## About

Rumblr is a social media app that's mostly inspired by Tumblr. Why Tumblr? Because it was the first social media site I ever really used, and it wound up being the one I used the most.

On Rumblr, you can create, share, like, and leave comments on posts. Rumblr allows users to reblog each other's posts while adding content to them. Unlike tumblr, users cannot mix post types (for now).
